# 004. Graceful (Degradation)

These thoughts are unstructured, I'm leaving them here to return to them later:

- Speaking plainly and saying what you mean is inclusive. More people should understand your point if you are clear about what you mean.
- To be accessible to a bigger audience does not equate to being more popular.
- Neither does it convince more people that the point you are making is valid or right.
- Plain speaking is not the same as simplifying. Complexity can be plain spoken, and simple points can be obscured by convoluted speech.
- The ideal state could be where complex concepts gracefully degrade and remain accessible for most whilst remaining factually correct
