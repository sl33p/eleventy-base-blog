# 008. Jaded (lockdown)

This is not a post as much as a reconstruction of sentences written during the lockdown in February 2021. I've come back to it a year and a bit later to try to pull together some sort of structure around the words I wrote then, so it might make sense to you, or a later me.


## Carpe diem is death

Seizing the day means living in the now. The problem with this is that if you live only in the now you are no different from someone with a 20 minute memory span. We need to be able to look forward to something different, something other than the constant loop. When that is taken from us, we suffer. In that way, Lockdown is like dementia.

We live through time, and mark time by the build up and release of energy. These highs and lows are like grooves in a record, etched into the resin of our memory. In order for us to feel and remember, friction is essential.

After all, the goal of [mindfulness](/posts/elsewhere/) is oblivion. Enlightenment entails releasing us from suffering, which reminds me of my favourite (short form) joke, the one about Buddah at the hot dog stand:

> â€”Make me one with everything
