# 001. Discipline (Preamble)
The purpose of writing whole paragraphs of text instead of bullet points is that you have to have a narrative throughout, which in turn requires you to think, or at least to concentrate, which is what makes it so hard to do.

I don’t know if it’s easier for some people to retain focus, or if I’m just lazy and undisciplined, or if I’d be diagnosed with some attention deficit acronym if a doctor got hold of me.

So the purpose then, of this weblog and the discipline it might bring, should I choose to keep it alive, is to force some thinking time. Just like a therapy session or meditation forces your brain into a specific state for a specific period of time, so does producing paragraphs. It's practising how to have discipline, and I have none. 

I have sought companions in work and life who can balance my lack of discipline by providing mechanisms where if I don't focus and do myself, they will discipline me. the problem with this approach is that choosing to do the right thing is righteous but doing it so you won't get into trouble is childish and demeaning. So that’s where I’m at. Trying to better myself through writing, one day at a time.
